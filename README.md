# NoI - Discord Bot
###### Bot created by Johannes Emmoth @ [jinado.se](http://jinado.se)

#### Background

I'm a student at a University in Sweden and I'm, at the time of writing, studying an introductory course
to University-level math. My teacher has been quoted to say:

> As you can see here, we want to get rid of all "i"'s and other shit like that

He said the above quote while teaching us how to solve complex equations. After he said that, an inside joke
started between I and a couple classmates which was to basically change all I's to \[REDACTED\], therefore taking
his quote rather literally.

We talked about how it would be fun if there was a Discord bot that could do exactly that, so I made one!

#### Usage

Using the bot is very simple. After having the bot join your server, you can start using it by prefixing your messages
with "!NoI". Any message written that begins with this prefix will have all its I's replaced with \[REDACTED\].

To automatically convert all messages sent on the server, without the need to prefix each message with "!NoI", just type
the following command:

```
!NoI autoConvert
```

The above command will toggle the setting to auto convert each message. If it is toggled to true, it will automatically convert
each message sent on the server, even the ones not prefixed with "!NoI".

If you ever wish to view all available commands and what they do, just type the below command!

!NoI help
